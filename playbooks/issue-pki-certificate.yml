# Simple PKI certificate issuance playbook
# Demonstrates how easy it is to get certificates from Vault without agent complexity
#
# This playbook:
# 1. Gathers target machine facts (FQDN)
# 2. AAP Execution Environment authenticates to Vault (trusted orchestrator pattern)
# 3. Issues certificate directly from the PKI engine
# 4. Copies certificate files to target machine in standard RHEL locations
#
# No Vault Agent required on target machines!
# AAP acts as the trusted bridge between Vault and target machines
